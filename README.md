# Local-Feature-Detection-Matching
Self study about finding interesting points with various methods (Harris corner, SIFT, ORB) and matching them.
All work was done in Colab.

## Harris corner

This is the result image when each flag value is given differently.
The values ​​of each flag are as follows:
  DRAW_MATCHES_FLAGS_DRAW_RICH_KEYPOINTS, DRAW_MATCHES_FLAGS_DEFAULT
  DRAW_MATCHES_FLAGS_NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS, 0

(For the image given flag=0, I gave the color (0, 255, 0))
